## About

Collect range datetime information from the users in a Screen Flow or another LWC component.
When the user set a value on the "startDate" input, the "endDate" input is autopopulated with a predefined time range.


## What I've learned

- Test LWC components with Jest
  - How to filter `shadowRoot.querySelectorAll()` results to find the exact target element.
  - Using `Promise.resolve().then()` before asserting the results to ensure that the components were updated on screen.
  - Debbuging Jest tests
  - Mocking Date.now() in Jest with `jest.spyOn()` and `mockImplementationOnce()`.
- Setting default value in a public `@api propety` when no value was defined by a parent component or a target config in Flow Screens/Lightning Pages, using `constructor()`. However, if a value is defined by the parent component, the constructor will be override.
- Use of `connectedCallback()` to wait for the component be loaded in the DOM.
- Pass output values from LWC component to Flow Screens.
