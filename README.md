## About

Collect range datetime information from the users in a Screen Flow or another LWC component.
When the user set a value on the "startDate" input, the "endDate" input is autopopulated with a predefined time range.


## What I've learned

As my first React Native project, I learned basic concepts like: development with state components structure. How components react to state changes and updates their data, how to navigate between screens, request APIs and list external data with infinite scrolling, etc.

- Test LWC components with Jest
  - How to filter shadowRoot.querySelectorAll() results to find the exact target element
  - Using Promise.resolve().then() before asserting the results to ensure that the components were updated on screen
